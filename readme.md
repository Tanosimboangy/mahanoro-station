# _Brief Description about this project:_
- I built this app in order to practice using Redux for handling state in React. 
- The home page shows four specific destinations, in which the users can click so that they can see on the next page the details about all available trips to their destination. On the next page, by clicking on the Book button, the user can see all of the availabe seats and click on the seat they want. In the home page, the "My account" link on the right page leads the user to see the booking seat.

- While working on this project, using Redux makes it easier to handle the state and update it.

- The design is from this figma link: [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/6gSAJpaedebKAUuaM4ekFR/Mahanoro-Station?node-id=4%3A38)
