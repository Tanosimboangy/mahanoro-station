# *Overview:*
 
 
# *You can see my demo here:*
- You can see my demo in this following link: [https://mahanoro-station-jacquit.netlify.app/](https://mahanoro-station-jacquit.netlify.app/).
 
# *My experience:*
 
 - I fetched all of the data through this given API: [https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Pinois/36bb5fbf9b6a686f0baf4006dd137bca/raw/a40d8b3f696a75f388db286d57bdd05a925fa0e7/trips.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Pinois/36bb5fbf9b6a686f0baf4006dd137bca/raw/a40d8b3f696a75f388db286d57bdd05a925fa0e7/trips.json). 
 
# *Anything I have learned/improved:*
 
- While doing this project, I learned: firstly, using all the ways to deal with an array, such as spread, map(), and filter().
 
- Apart from that, I started to fully understand more about how to use Redux, as well as style components, and how they work.
- Since I could not finish the booking seats and myAccount functionalities, I would like to improve it.
 
# *My wisdom:*
 
- In the face of bugs, I tried to do my best to fully understand what is going on before asking for help from google.
 
- I tried to rely on google, I did a lot of research  while fulfilling this task.
